# Java  ‚ù§üòé‚òï

## Description
Welcome to my Java learning repository! This is the place where I will document my journey in Java programming, recording my notes and exercises.

## Repository Structure
- `/introduction`: In this folder, you will find theoretical summaries of the lessons, covering fundamental Java concepts such as variables, control structures, classes, objects, and more.
- `/OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)`: Here, you will find the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming.
- `Branch - exercises`: In the exercises folder, practical challenges will be available for me to apply the knowledge acquired during the lessons and enhance my Java skills.

## Objective
The main goal of this repository is to track my progress in learning Java. By keeping a record of the lessons and projects developed, I intend to have a reference for future consultations and solidify my knowledge in the language.

## Instructions
If you wish to follow my lessons or even learn along, feel free to clone this repository to your local development environment. You can use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucascampos04/java.git
```

Feel free to explore the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) folder to learn about the fundamental pillars of Java's Object-Oriented Programming.

Enjoy the journey of Java programming with me! üòäüëç
